# RayTracer
#### Authors: Hyegi Bang, Athmika Senthimukar, Sherrie Shen 

### Project Goal 
The goal of the project is to implement a ray tracing program. The minimum viable product is a ray tracing program that renders a properly lighted image given a scene with only spheres. The stretch goal would be having the ray tracing program to render a properly lighted image given a scenes with more diverse objects.

### Learning Goal 
Our learning goals for this project is to build up knowledge about graphics programming in C. Another goal is to learn the math behind ray tracing and be able to implement mathematical functions effectively using structs. We also want to improve our skills around writing well planned, well organized C code that is easy to read and modify. 

### Resources 
To get started, we will read the ray tracer tutorial on sphere from a ray tracer tutorial that covers the mathematics of ray tracing for sphere and provides example code: https://www.purplealienplanet.com/node/20 
</br>

Other resources that provides examples for ray tracer program with more complex surface than spheres:
* Example raytace program in C: https://www.purplealienplanet.com/node/20
* 3D C/C++ tutorials - Ray tracing: http://www.3dcpptutorials.sk/index.php?id=16
* Introduction to Ray Tracing: a Simple Method for Creating 3D Images: https://www.scratchapixel.com/lessons/3d-basic-rendering/introduction-to-ray-tracing/ray-tracing-practical-example
* A small, simple path tracer written in C: https://github.com/VKoskiv/c-ray

### Plan 
We will start with reading and understanding the example ray tracer on spheres [https://www.purplealienplanet.com/node/20]. We will focus on understanding the basic mathematical model. We can consider this task done when we explain the math concepts to each other. </br>

Next, we will study how to render graphics in c. By the end of this task, we will be able to generate a sphere with given inputs. </br>

Finally, we will implement the mathematical equations of the ray tracer with spheres by identifying general architecture of the code, structs and objects that are necessary and assign sections to team members based on individual’s preferences. This task is considered done when we create a ray tracer for spheres. </br>
