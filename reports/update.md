# ThinkRayTracer
### Software Systems Project 2

## Project Vision
The goal of the project is to implement a ray tracing program. The minimum viable product is a ray tracing program that renders a properly lighted image given a scene with only spheres in 2d and 3d. The stretch goal would be having the ray tracing program to render a properly lighted image given a scene with more diverse objects such as cubes and prisms.

### Learning Goal
Our learning goals for this project is to build up knowledge about graphics programming in C. Another goal is to learn the math behind ray tracing and be able to implement mathematical functions effectively using structs. We also want to improve our skills around writing well planned, well organized C code that is easy to read and modify.

### Project Workflow
Majority of the work was done through pair programming during our weekly meetings. We used "teletype” in atom, which allowed us to share the workspace with and collaborate on code in real time. Trello board contains a similar work environment. Most of the tasks were thought during the meeting and to prevent overlaps of tabs, one person became the scribe and added the cards. Therefore, the github commit history and trello board doesn’t fully represent the team’s contribution. However, all work were distributed and done equally within the teammates.


### Resources
To get started, we read the ray tracer tutorial on sphere from a ray tracer tutorial that covers the mathematics of ray tracing for sphere and provides example code: https://www.purplealienplanet.com/node/20
</br>

We also watched the video going over the maths of raytracing in 2D for a sphere: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOeOuZGmeCM&t=892s
</br>

Other resources that provides examples for ray tracer program with more complex surface than spheres:
